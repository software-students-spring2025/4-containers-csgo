# Containerized App Exercise

Build a containerized app that uses machine learning. See [instructions](./instructions.md) for details.

## Sentiment Hub
**Description**: This project is a web-based, containerized sentiment analysis application where users can type in their feelings through a keyboard interface. The input is processed using a machine learning client powered by VADER Sentiment, and the results are displayed in a shared emotional space that reflects the collective mood of all records. The concept behind the app is to create a space for emotional awareness and connection, hoping to offer insight into both people's own feelings and the shared emotional state of a community.
